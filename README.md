Learning to use Git
Someday this tool will prove to be very useful for me. Learning now for utility later!

Repository = folder for all things related to a project
Branch = versions, Master = top level branch to which all other versions can be compiled (committed)
Example: you've worked on part of the main file to make understanding the flow easier. Once it's the way you like it, you save the changes back to the Master. You commit those changes.

DOCUMENT everything in commit messages: why a change is needed, what was done. Future You (and anybody else whom you want to be able to understand what you've done) will thank you!
